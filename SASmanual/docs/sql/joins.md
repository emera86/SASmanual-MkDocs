## Understanding SQL Joins

If you're working with tables that have different columns, you can combine tables horizontally to combine the columns that you want in your output.

```
SELECT object-item <, ...object-item>
  FROM from-list
  <additional clauses>;
```

To combine tables horizontally, you can use either the `SELECT` statement in `PROC SQL` or the `MERGE` statement in the `DATA` step. The results of an SQL join and a `DATA` step merge are similar but not always identical.

Whatever method you use, you must also specify criteria for matching and combining the rows across the tables.

### Inner joins and Outer joins

`PROC SQL` supports two types of joins:

* **Inner joins:** return a result table that contains all of the matching rows in the input tables. The result of an inner join does not include any nonmatching rows.
*  **Outer joins:** return a result table that contains all of the matching rows in the input tables and some or all of the nonmatching rows from one or both tables.

There are three types of outer joins:

* A full outer join returns all of the matching rows plus the nonmatching rows from both tables.
* A left outer join returns all of the matching rows plus the nonmatching rows from the first, or left, table.
* A right outer join returns all of the matching rows plus the nonmatching rows from the second, or right, table.

When performing an SQL join, the SQL processor first generates all possible combinations of all of the rows in the tables to be combined. An intermediate result table that contains all possible combinations of rows in the input tables is called a **Cartesian product**. From the rows in the Cartesian product, the SQL processor can then select the appropriate rows for an inner join or an outer join.

### Cartesian product

The number of rows in a Cartesian product is the product of the number of rows in the contributing tables.

```
SELECT object-item <, ...object-item>
  FROM table-name, table-name
    <,...table-name>;
```

A Cartesian product is rarely the result that you want when you join tables.

To create a Cartesian product, you use the `SELECT` statement without specifying any conditions for matching rows.

**Example:** Creating a Cartesian Product 
```
proc sql;
select *
   from customers, transactions, inventory;
quit;
```

### Cross Join (Cartesian product)

You can also use alternative syntax, called cross join syntax, to produce the Cartesian product of two tables.

```
SELECT object-item <, ...object-item>
  FROM table-name-1 CROSS JOIN table-name-2;
```

In the `FROM` clause, the table names are separated by the `CROSS JOIN` keywords instead of by a comma.

## Working with Inner Joins

### Performing an Inner Join

Inner join returns only the matching rows. Another way to say this is that an inner join returns rows that meet certain join conditions that you specify.

```
SELECT object-item <, ...object-item>
  FROM table-name, table-name
  WHERE join-condition(s)
    <AND sql-expression>
  <additional clauses>;
```

The syntax for an inner join requires a `WHERE` clause in addition to the `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses. In the `WHERE` clause, one or more join conditions specify the combined rows that the query should return.

**Example:**
```
proc sql;
select *
  from customers, transactions
  where customers.ID=transactions.ID;
quit;

proc sql;
select c.ID, Name, Action, Amount
   from customers as c, transactions as t
   where c.ID=t.ID;
quit;
```

The join conditions are specified as expressions. The `WHERE` clause can also contain one or more additional expressions that subset the rows in additional ways.

The column or columns that are specified in join conditions are referred to as join keys.
Using `PROC SQL`, you can also specify join keys that have different names. However, by default, a `DATA` step merge requires the join keys to have the same name in both tables.

`PROC SQL` can join tables that are not sorted on the join keys, unlike a `DATA` step merge.

When you refer to columns in multiple tables that have the same name, you must qualify the column names to specify the location of each column. **Qualified column names** consist of the table name (a table qualifier), a period, and then the column name.

A join on an equal condition is called an **equijoin**. Using `PROC SQL`, you can also join tables on an inequality. However, `DATA` step merges can only join tables on an equality.

Conceptually, when `PROC SQL` processes an inner join, the SQL processor performs two main steps:

1. Builds the Cartesian product of all tables listed in the `FROM` clause
2. Eliminates the rows that don't meet the join conditions

A `DATA` step merge does not create a Cartesian product.

Unlike `DATA` step merges, SQL joins do not overlay columns that have the same name. By default, the result set contains all of the columns that have the same name.

To display columns that are the same as, or derived from, columns in multiple tables, you must use a join instead of a subquery.

By default, a `DATA` step merge builds a result set in the order of the join key values. `PROC SQL` does not order the rows in query results by default. To guarantee the order of the rows, you must use an `ORDER BY` clause.

```
SELECT object-item <, ...object-item>
  FROM table-name <AS> alias-1
    table-name-2 <AS> alias-2
  WHERE join-condition(s)
  <additional clauses>;
```

You can simplify the syntax of your SQL joins by assigning aliases to tables in the `FROM` clause.

**Example:**
```
  SELECT c.ID, Name, Action, Amount
    FROM customers as c, transactions as t
    WHERE c.ID=t.ID;
```

After the table name, you can optionally specify the keyword `AS` and then the alias. The alias must follow the standard rules for SAS names. In other clauses, you can reference each table by its alias instead of by its full name.

### Using Alternative Syntax for an Inner Join 

You can also perform an inner join by using the alternative syntax shown here.

```
SELECT object-item <, ...object-item>
  FROM table-name-1 <<AS> alias-1>
    INNER JOIN
    table-name-2 <<AS> alias-2>
  ON join-condition(s)
  WHERE sql-expression
  <additional clauses>;
```

In the alternate syntax for an inner join, the `FROM` clause uses the `INNER JOIN` keywords to join two tables. The alternate syntax uses the `ON` clause to specify the join conditions. The alternate syntax allows additional clauses, so you can still use the `WHERE` clause to specify any additional subsetting conditions.

**Example:**
```
proc sql;
select c.ID, Name, Action, Amount
  from customers as c
    inner join transactions as t
    on c.ID=t.ID;
quit;
    
proc sql;
select c.ID, Name, Action, Amount
   from customers as c
        inner join
        transactions as t
   on c.ID=t.ID;
quit;
```

## Working with Outer Joins

```
SELECT object-item <, ...object-item>
  FROM table-name <<AS> alias>
    LEFT|RIGHT|FULL JOIN
    table-name <<AS> alias>
  ON join-condition(s)
  <additional clauses>;
```

The syntax for outer joins is similar to the alternate syntax for inner joins. In an outer join, the `FROM` clause lists two table names with keywords that indicate the type of join in between: `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, or `FULL JOIN`. The left table is the first table listed, and the right table is the second table. The `ON` clause specifies the join conditions. As with inner joins, you can also add optional clauses, such as a `WHERE` clause, to subset the rows.

#### Performing a Left Outer Join

Use a left outer join to select **all the rows in the customers table and only the matching rows in the transactions table**.

**Example:**
```
proc sql;
  SELECT *
    FROM customers as c
      LEFT JOIN
      transactions as t
        ON c.ID=t.ID;
quit;
```

#### Performing a Right Outer Join

Use a right outer join to select **all the rows in the transactions table and only the matching rows in the customers table**.

**Example:**
```
proc sql;
  SELECT *
    FROM customers as c
      RIGHT JOIN transactions as t
        ON c.ID=t.ID;
quit;
```

#### Performing a Full Outer Join

We want the query to combine and return **all matching rows and also to return the rows from both tables that do not match**.

**Example:**
```
proc sql;
  SELECT *
    FROM customers as c
      FULL JOIN transactions as t
        ON c.ID=t.ID;
quit;
```
In a full outer join, the **order of the tables affects the order of the columns in the result set**. The columns from the left table appear before the columns from the right table.

Outer joins can only process two tables at a time. However, you can stack multiple outer joins in a single query.

```
COALESCE(argument-1,argument-2<,argument-n>)
```

To overlay columns in SQL joins, you can use the `COALESCE` function, which is a SAS function. The `COALESCE` function returns the value of the first nonmissing argument from two or more arguments that you specify. An argument can be a constant, an expression, or a column name. All arguments must be of the same type.

**Example:** Using the `COALESCE` Function to Overlay Columns
```
proc sql;
select coalesce(c.ID,t.ID) as ID,
       Name, Action, Amount
   from customers c full join transactions t
   on c.ID=t.ID;
quit;
```

### Differences between a `PROC SQL` join and a `DATA STEP` merge

The table below shows the differences between a `PROC SQL` join and a `DATA STEP` merge.

Key Points	                                | SQL Join	    | DATA Step Merge
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Explicit sorting of data before join/merge	| Not required	| Required
Same-name columns in join/merge expressions	| Not required	| Required
Equality in join or merge expressions	      | Not required	| Required

The table below shows the differences between inner and outer joins.

Key Points	| Inner Join	| Outer Join
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Table Limit	| 256	| 256
Join Behavior	| Returns matching rows only	| Returns matching and non-matching rows
Join Options	| Matching rows only	| `LEFT`, `FULL`, `RIGHT`
Syntax Changes | Multiple tables in the `FROM` clause (separated by commas); `WHERE` clause that specifies join criteria | `ON` clause that specifies join criteria

## Working with Complex SQL Joins

Even if the information you need for your report is located in only two tables, you may need to read the same table twice, or even more times.

```
  FROM table-name-1 <AS> alias-1,
      table-name-1 <AS> alias-2,
```

In order to read from the same table twice, it must be listed in the `FROM` clause twice. A different table alias is required for each listing to distinguish the different uses. This is called a **self-join**, or a reflexive join.

**Example:** Performing a Complex Join
```
proc sql;
select e.Employee_ID "Employee ID",
          e.Employee_Name "Employee Name",
          m.Employee_ID "Manager ID",
          m.Employee_Name "Manager Name",
          e.Country
   from orion.employee_addresses as e,
           orion.employee_addresses as m,
           orion.employee_organization as o
   where e.Employee_ID=o.Employee_ID and
              o.Manager_ID=m.Employee_ID and
              Department contains 'Sales'
   order by Country,4,1;
quit;
```
