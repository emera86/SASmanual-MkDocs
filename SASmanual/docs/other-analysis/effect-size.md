## [Cohen's d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d)

Cohen's d is defined as the difference between two means divided by a standard deviation for the data, i.e.

$d = \frac{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2}{s}=\frac{\mu_1-\mu_2}{s}$.

By default SPSS and SAS compute the SD as an inferential statistic (i.e., S) rather than as the population parameter (i.e., $\sigma$) by using N-1 in the denominator of the SD equation rather than N. In order to obtain Cohen's d rather than Hedge's g, the inferential statistic S will be transformed to $\sigma$.
