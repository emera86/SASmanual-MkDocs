## Dose Intensity

In comparing various protocols you will find that not only do doses vary from one protocol to the next, but also how many doses and when they are given. This can make comparisons difficult or impossible.

### Absolute Dose Intensity

The concept of **Dose Intensity (DI)** may allow a rough comparison. Dose Intensity is the total amount of drug given in a fixed unit of time (usually 1 week), thus is a function of dose and frequency of administration.

### Relative Dose Intensity

The **Relative Dose Intensity (RDI)** is the ratio of *delivered* respect to the *planned* dose intensity and can be expressed as a percentage. An RDI of 100% indicates that the drug was administered at the dose planned per protocol, without delay and without cancellations.

### Derived Variables

Key derived variables for exposure derived datasets could be:

* The **Cumulative dose**, usually given in $mg$, is the sum of all administered Dose/Cycles
* The **Planned Treatment Duration** ($days$) is the planned time between two consecutive administrations, i.e. the planned cycle duration
* The **Treatment Duration** ($weeks$) is calculated as: (date of last administration of trial drug - date of first administration of trial drug + Planned Duration)/ 7
* The **Dose Intensity (DI)** ($mg/week$) is calculated as: Cumulative dose ($mg$) / Treatment duration ($weeks$)
* The **Planned Dose Intensity (PDI)** ($mg/week$) is calculated as: Cumulative planned dose ($mg$) / Planned Treatment duration ($weeks$)
* The **Relative Dose Intensity (RDI)** ($%$) is calculated as: 100 * DI ($mg/week$) / PDI ($mg/week$). 


An RDI of 100% indicates that the drug was administered at the right dose within the planned timeframe.

Dose may also measured as mg/m2 when treatment are infused, in this case the total dose expressed in 'mg' is divided by the subject BSA (m2) measured at the time of the drug administration.
Both Dose Intensity and Relative Dose Intensity together with Cumulative Dose and Treatment Duration, are described by means of descriptive statistics for continuos variables.
Additionally frequency distribution together with % of Nr. of Administered Cycle is also provided.
In combination studies, when applicable, the above information are derived and presented for each drugs administered.
