**Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)** were developed and published in 2000, based on the original World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines first published in 1981. In 2009, revisions were made (RECIST 1.1) incorporating major changes, including 

* a reduction in the **number of lesions** to be assessed, 
* a new measurement method to classify **lymph nodes** as pathologic or normal, 
* the clarification of the requirement to **confirm a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)** and 
* new methodologies for more appropriate **measurement of disease progression**.
