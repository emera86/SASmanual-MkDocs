## Hematology

**Hematology** is the study of blood and blood disorders to help in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the blood and bone marrow as well as of the immunologic, hemostatic (blood clotting) and vascular systems. Because of the nature of blood, the science of hematology profoundly affects the understanding of many diseases.

All our **blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow**. Stem cells are blood cells at the earliest stage of development and they stay inside the bone marrow until they are fully developed which is when they go into the bloodstream. Blood cells do not live long. The bone marrow normally makes millions of new blood cells every day to replace blood cells as they are needed.

The three main types of blood cells are:

* **Red blood cells (RBC) or erythrocytes** are the most common type of blood cells. They lack a cell nucleus and most organelles, in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin, with a plasma membrane as the sack.  
    * **Hemoglobin (HGB)** is an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells and the blood.
    * The **hematocrit (HCT)**, is the volume percentage of red blood cells in blood.

* **Platelets (PLAT) or thrombocytes** help the blood to clot and prevent bleeding and bruising.
* **White blood cells (WBC) or leucocytes** fight and prevent infection.
    * **Basophils (BASO)**
    * **Eosinophils (EOS)**
    * **Neutrophils (NEUT)**
    * **Monocytes (MONO)**
    * **Lymphocytes (LYM)**

### Normal Ranges' Rule of Thumb 

| **Type of blood cell** | **Unit**   | **Levels**                       |
|------------------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Red blood cells (RBC)  | g/l        | Men: 130-180, Women: 115-165     |
| Hematocrit (HCT)       | %          | Men: 41-50, Women: 36-44         |
| Hemoglobin (HGB)       | g/l        | Men: 13.5-16.5, Women: 12.0-15.0 |
| Platelets              | 10^9/L     | 150-400                          |
| White blood cells      | 10^9/L     | 4.0-11.0                         |
| Neutrophils            | 10^9/L     | 2.0-7.5                          |
| Lymphocytes            | 10^9/L     | 1.5-4.5                          |

### Blood-Related Anomalies

* **Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)**, defined as absolute neutrophils count divided by absolute lymphocytes count, has been reported as poor prognostic factor in several neoplastic diseases. In the case of colorectal cancer, elevated pre-operative ($NLR>5$) is associated with poorer long-term survival. NLR is a useful biomarker in delineating those patients with poorer prognosis and whom may benefit from adjuvant therapies.
* **Leucocytosis**, often defined as an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count greater than $11000/mm^3$ ($11.0 \cdot 10^9/L$) in nonpregnant adults, is a relatively common finding with a wide differential. It is important for clinicians to be able to distinguish malignant from nonmalignant etiologies, and to differentiate between the most common nonmalignant causes of leukocytosis. Leukocytosis in the range of approximately $50-100 \cdot 10^9/L$ is sometimes referred to as a **leukemoid reaction**. This level of elevation can occur in some severe infections, such as Clostridium difficile infection, sepsis, organ rejection, or in patients with solid tumors. Leukocytosis greater than $100 \cdot 10^9/L$ is almost always caused by leukemias or myeloproliferative disorders.
* An abnormally low hematocrit (as well as a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood) may suggest **anemia**, a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells, while an abnormally high hematocrit is called **polycythemia**. Both are potentially life-threatening disorders.
* **Thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis** is the presence of high platelet counts in the blood. Although often symptomless, it can predispose to thrombosis in some patients. Thrombocytosis can be contrasted with **thrombocytopenia**, a loss of platelets in the blood.

## Biomarkers

* **CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen)** is a protein found in many types of cells but associated with tumors and the developing fetus. A common cutoff is $5 \mu g/L$ (values bigger than this could be a sign of disease).
* Mutations in **KRAS exon 2**, **BRAF** and **PIK3CA** are commonly present in colorectal cancer (CRC).
