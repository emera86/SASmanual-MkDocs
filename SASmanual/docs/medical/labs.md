## Hematology

**Hematology** is the study of blood and blood disorders to help in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the blood and bone marrow as well as of the immunologic, hemostatic (blood clotting) and vascular systems. Because of the nature of blood, the science of hematology profoundly affects the understanding of many diseases.

All our **blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow**. Stem cells are blood cells at the earliest stage of development and they stay inside the bone marrow until they are fully developed which is when they go into the bloodstream. Blood cells do not live long. The bone marrow normally makes millions of new blood cells every day to replace blood cells as they are needed.

The three main types of blood cells are:

* **Red blood cells (RBC)** contain **haemoglobin (HGB)**, which carries oxygen from the lungs to all the cells in our body.
* **Platelets (PLAT)** help the blood to clot and prevent bleeding and bruising.
* **White blood cells (WBC) or leucocytes** fight and prevent infection.

There are two main types of white blood cell. These are called **neutrophils** and **lymphocytes**. Neutrophils are the most common. You will hear your doctor or nurse talk about your neutrophil count during your treatment.

### Normal Ranges' Rule of Thumb 

| **Type of blood cell** | **Levels**                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Red blood cells (Hb)   | 130-180 g/l (men), 115-165 g/L (women) |
| Platelets              | 150-400 路 10^9/L                       |
| White blood cells      | 4.0-11.0 路 10^9/L                      |
| Neutrophils            | 2.0-7.5 路 10^9/L                       |
| Lymphocytes            | 1.5-4.5 路 10^9/L                       |

### Blood-Related Anomalies

* **Leucocytosis**, often defined as an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count greater than $11000/mm^3$ ($11.0 \cdot 10^9/L$) in nonpregnant adults, is a relatively common finding with a wide differential. It is important for clinicians to be able to distinguish malignant from nonmalignant etiologies, and to differentiate between the most common nonmalignant causes of leukocytosis. Leukocytosis in the range of approximately $50-100 \cdot 10^9/L$ is sometimes referred to as a **leukemoid reaction**. This level of elevation can occur in some severe infections, such as Clostridium difficile infection, sepsis, organ rejection, or in patients with solid tumors. Leukocytosis greater than $100 \cdot 10^9/L$ is almost always caused by leukemias or myeloproliferative disorders.
* **Anemia**
* **Tromocytosis**

## Biomarkers

* **CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen)** is a protein found in many types of cells but associated with tumors and the developing fetus. A common cutoff is $5 \mu g/L$ (values bigger than this could be a sign of disease).
* Mutations in **KRAS exon 2**, **BRAF** and **PIK3CA** are commonly present in colorectal cancer (CRC).
