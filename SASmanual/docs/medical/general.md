## Symptons vs Signs

A **symptom is any subjective evidence** of disease, while a **sign is any objective evidence** of disease. Therefore, a symptom is a phenomenon that is experienced by the individual affected by the disease, while a sign is a phenomenon that can be detected by someone other than the individual affected by the disease.

The **Charlson Comorbidity Index** was first developed by [Mary Charlson and colleagues (1987)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=3558716&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum) as a weighted index to predict risk of death within 1 year of hospitalization for patients with specific comorbid conditions. **Nineteen conditions** were included in the index. Each condition was assigned a **weight from 1 to 6**, based on the estimated 1-year mortality hazard ratio from a Cox proportional hazards model. These weights were summed to produce the **Charlson comorbidity score**. Some years later, [Richard Deyo (1992)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=1607900&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum) and [Patrick Romano (1993)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=8410092&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum) separately adapted the Charlson index to ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes and CPT-4 codes so that the index could be calculated using administrative data.

In 2000 Carrie Klabunde and colleagues developed a **cancer-specific NCI Comorbidity Index** using breast and prostate cancer cases included in the SEER-Medicare data. [Klabunde et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11146273) used codes on the Medicare data to identify the conditions identified by Charlson et al. The NCI Comorbidity Index excludes solid tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas as comorbid conditions, given that the NCI Comorbidity Index was developed from a cohort of cancer patients. The remaining 16 Charlson index conditions were included in the NCI Comorbidity Index, with further consolidation to **14 conditions**. 

The approach for creating the NCI Comorbidity Index included review of Medicare claims for the year prior to the date of diagnosis, excluding the month of diagnosis. **Separate comorbidity indexes** were created **for hospitalizations** (Medicare Part A) **and physician claims** (Medicare Part B). Conditions ascertained by physician claims were required to occur more than once in a period greater than 30 days to reduce the risk of false positives. These indexes were later **combined into a single NCI Comorbidity Index**, which allowed for greater efficiency in analysis.
