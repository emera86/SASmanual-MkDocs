## Symptons vs Signs

A **symptom is any subjective evidence** of disease, while a **sign is any objective evidence** of disease. Therefore, a symptom is a phenomenon that is experienced by the individual affected by the disease, while a sign is a phenomenon that can be detected by someone other than the individual affected by the disease.
