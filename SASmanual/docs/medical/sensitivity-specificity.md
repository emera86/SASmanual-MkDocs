Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test, also known in statistics as a classification function, that are widely used in medicine:

* **Sensitivity** (also called the true positive rate) measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition). It is often mistakenly confused with the detection limit, while the detection limit is calculated from the analytical sensitivity, not from the epidemiological sensitivity.
* **Specificity** (also called the true negative rate) measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition).

* **Positive predictive value (PPV)** is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease.
* **Negative predictive value (NPV)** is the probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly don't have the disease.
