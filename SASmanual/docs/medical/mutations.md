## RAS mutations

Rat sarcoma virus (RAS) proto-oncogenes encode 21,000-dalton membrane bound small GTPases that include Harvey-Ras (HRAS), Kirsten-Ras (KRAS), and neuroblastoma-Ras (NRAS), collectively called RAS. RAS gene mutations are among the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers, found in approximately 30% of all tumor types and in approximately 50% of **colorectal cancer** (CRC).

This group of genes are involved in a pathway called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and acts as an on/off switch in cell signalling. When it functions normally, it controls cell proliferation. When it is mutated, negative signalling is disrupted. Thus, cells can continuously proliferate, and often develop into cancer.

Despite the efforts to find a clinically effective inhibitor, targeting RAS mutations has remained elusive, so much so that some have termed oncogenic RAS mutations as "undruggable". In addition, oncogenic RAS mutations cause acquired resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies such as **cetuximab and panitumumab**.
