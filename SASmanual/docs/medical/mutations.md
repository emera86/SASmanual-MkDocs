## RAS mutations

Rat sarcoma virus (RAS) proto-oncogenes encode 21,000-dalton membrane bound small GTPases that include Harvey-Ras (HRAS), Kirsten-Ras (KRAS), and neuroblastoma-Ras (NRAS), collectively called RAS. RAS gene mutations are among the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers, found in approximately 30% of all tumor types and in approximately 50% of **colorectal cancer** (CRC).

This group of genes are involved in a pathway called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and acts as an on/off switch in cell signalling. When it functions normally, it controls cell proliferation. When it is mutated, negative signalling is disrupted. Thus, cells can continuously proliferate, and often develop into cancer.

Despite the efforts to find a clinically effective inhibitor, targeting RAS mutations has remained elusive, so much so that some have termed oncogenic RAS mutations as "undruggable". In addition, oncogenic RAS mutations cause acquired resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies such as **cetuximab and panitumumab**.

* **HRAS**:
* **KRAS or K-ras or Ki-ras** is a short name for the gene v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog. 

* **NRAS**:

## BRAF

BRAF is a human gene that encodes a protein called B-Raf. The gene is also referred to as proto-oncogene B-Raf and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B, while the protein is more formally known as serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf.

The BRAF gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. This protein is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which controls several important cell functions. Specifically, the RAS/MAPK pathway regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Chemical signaling through this pathway is essential for normal development before birth.
