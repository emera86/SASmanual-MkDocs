## iRECIST vs RECIST 1.1

### Unchanged

* Definitions of measurable, non-measurable disease 
* Definitions of target (T) and non target (NT) lesions 
* Measurement and management of nodal disease 
* Calculation of the sum of measurement (SOM) 
* Definitions of complete (CR) and partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and their duration 
* Confirmation of CR and PR and when applicable 
* Definition of progression in T and NT (iRECIST terms i-unconfirmed progression (iUPD))

### Changed

* Management of new lesions 
* Time point response after RECIST 1.1 progression 
* Confirmation of progression required 
* Collection of reason why progression cannot be confirmed 
* Inclusion and recording of clinical status

### New Lesions

New lesions (NL) are assessed using RECIST 1.1 principles: 
* Classified as measurable or non-measurable 
* Up to 5 (2 per site) measured (but not included in the sum of measurements of target lesions identified at baseline) and recorded as new lesions target (NL-T) with an i-sum of measurements (iSOM) 
* Other new lesions (measurable/non-measurable) are recorded as new lesions non-target (NL-NT) 
* New lesions do not have to resolve for subsequent iSD or iPR providing that the next assessment did not confirm progression

### Time Point Response

In iRECIST there can be *iSD*, *iPR* or *iCR* after RECIST 1.1 PD 
* ‘once a PD always a PD’ is no longer the case 
* First RECIST 1.1 PD is “unconfirmed” for iRECIST – termed **iUPD** 
* iUPD must be confirmed at the next assessment (4-8 weeks) 
* If confirmed, termed **iCPD**

Time point response is dynamic and based on:
* Change from baseline (for iCR, iPR, iSD) or change from nadir (for PD) 
* The last i-response

### Progression

Treatment past RECIST 1.1 PD should only be considered if patient clinically stable (recommendation, may be protocol specific): 
* No worsening of performance status
* No clinically relevant worsening in disease related symptoms 
* No requirement for intensified management of disease related symptoms (analgesics, radiation, palliative care) 

Record the reason iUPD not confirmed: 
* Not stable 
* Treatment stopped but patient not reassessed/imaging not performed 
* iCPD never occurs 
* Patient has died
