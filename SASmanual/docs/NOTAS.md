[McNemar's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNemar%27s_test) vs Kappa

McNemar's test is a statistical test used on paired nominal data. It is applied to 2 Ã— 2 contingency tables with a dichotomous trait, with matched pairs of subjects, to determine whether the row and column marginal frequencies are equal (that is, whether there is "marginal homogeneity"). The null hypothesis of marginal homogeneity states that the two marginal probabilities for each outcome are the same.
