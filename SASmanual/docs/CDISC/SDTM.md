**CDISC** (Clinical Data Interchanging Standards Consortium) standards are to support the acquisition, exchange, submission and archival of clinical trial and research data. **SDTM** (Study Data Tabulation Model) for **CRFs** (Case Report Forms) was recommended for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory submissions since 2004. Although the SDTM Implementation Guide gives a standardized and predefined collection of submission metadata "domains" containing extensive variable collections, transforming CRFs to SDTM files for FDA submission is still a very hard and time-consuming task.

There is no common rule for converting clinical trial data to CDISC standard-compliant data. Without automation, they require labor intensive or time-consuming processes such as
re-entering data and manually mapping the data to the standard models.
