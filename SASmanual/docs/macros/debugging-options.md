## Debugging During Compilation

### `MCOMPILENOTE=` Option

By default, SAS does not display any indication that a macro has completed compilation. You can use the `MCOMPILENOTE=` option with the `ALL` argument to issue a note to the SAS log after a macro compiles.
```
  OPTIONS MCOMPILENOTE=NONE | ALL;
```

## Tracking Errors During Macro Execution

### `MPRINT` Option

The `MPRINT` option displays the SAS statements generated by macro execution.
```
OPTIONS MPRINT | NOMPRINT;
```

### `MLOGIC` Option

The `MLOGIC` option prints messages that indicate macro actions that were taken during macro execution.
```
OPTIONS MLOGIC | NOMLOGIC;
```

When the `MLOGIC` system option is in effect, the messages that SAS displays in the log include information about the following:
* The beginning of macro execution
* The values of any parameters
* The results of arithmetic and logical macro operations
* The end of macro execution

When you're working with a program that uses SAS macro language, you should typically turn the `MLOGIC` option, along with the `MPRINT` option and the `SYMBOLGEN` option
* `on` for development and debugging purposes
* `off` when the program is in production mode
